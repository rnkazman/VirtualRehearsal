The VRR (Virtual Rehearsal Room) is build on a Raspberry Pi 4.
  * xxx RAM
  * xxx Memory
  
Software:
  Ubuntu 64-bit  ver. ???
  Jamulus ver. ???
  Jitsi Meet ver. ???
  
  
Installation:
  Installation will be done by the our project support team. Team members is TBD.
  
Installation process:
  TBD


Logging:
  Since the VRR is expected to run unattended, there should be a logging function.
     * collect run-time errors
     * collect periodic performance snapshots (every 5 minutes?)
          * number of users
          * Jamulus CPU load
          * Jitsi CPU load
          * latency stats
     * log shutdown and startup events
         
  The log should be in CSV format for easy analysis.
  The log will be emailed to <tbd mailbox> every 6 hours.
  
  Is the system fast enough to email the log on shutdown or panic?
  
  Notes:
  We want to collect data to profile system load vs number of users.
  There is significant speculation on system loading. Let's collect the data.
  Similarly, we want to collect network latency data.
