===========
Installing Jitsi
===========
Run the following commands to install Jitsi:

sudo /root/jitsi/1-setup_hosts.bash
sudo /root/jitsi/2-firewall_config.bash
sudo /root/jitsi/3-jitsi_install.bash

You will need a fully qualified domain name, and a static IP address.

Optionally, you can provide Jitsi with a TLS certificate. Otherwise you can follow the instructions below to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate after the install.

===========
Let's Encrypt Certificate
===========
Run the below command only after you have installed Jitsi with a self-signed certificate:

sudo /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh

===========
Check the following logs if there are problems:
/var/log/jitsi/jvb.log
