Step 1 -  MacOS and Win10 (plus a few older Windows versions)
           This is the basic set.
           We recognize that Win10 and all the Windows family are hard to support.
           Most Windows don't understand the concepts of drivers and driver configurations. 
               Just giving users cookbook instructions doesn't completely solve the problem because there are variations 
               depending on their hardware configruation. Further they don't know if they have made a mistake.
           
           For scaling up, we probably need a remote support tool so that we can configure their device for them. 

Step 2 - Jamnulus OS
          We need to explore this as a solution for Windows users.
          
          This is also a solution for inexpensive devices.
          Chromebook hardware or other lowcost Wintel devices would be ideal platform for Jamulus OS.
          We need to test how sensitive Jamulus OS is to different audio chipsets.
          
          N.B. Raspberry Pi is not an option as it will require monitor and keyboard/mouse. Some UI will be needed.
          When monitor and input devices are considered, a tablet-style wintel device will be cheaper.
          
Step 3 - Chromebooks
          There is no path to making Jamulus work for ChromeOS. 
          Linux support is only for developer tools to help developers create new ChromeOS solutions.
          ChromeOS solutions require applications to be Chrome extensions.
          
          The only possible path forward is in partnership with Google. 
          This would take strong traction with the schools before Google is impressed and interested.
