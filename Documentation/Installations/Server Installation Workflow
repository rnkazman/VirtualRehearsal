Planning
    * IP address        Will the server be behind a NAT or a router?
                        If behind a NAT, then this is a small network and the server will be in the DMZ.
                        IF behind a router, then the site needs to assign an IP address.
                        
    * Host name         If host is behind a NAT, then select a host name in the form of <host>.eyc-labs.com
                            where perferably <host> = HI-Studio<num>. We will assign value of <num>.
                        If the host is behind a router, the selewct a host name in the form of <host>.<domain name>.
                            Ex: <domain name> = punahou.edu.
                            where preferably (for the evaluation period) <host> = HI-Studio<num>.
                        Ideally we want the central Jamulus server to show our test servers as HI-Studio<num>.
                        
     * Jamulus server name
                    * It is preferred to be the same as the same name as the FQDN
                        
     * Remote-support-aggrement
                        Confirm agreement for remote-support. 
                        During the evaluation phase, we need remote ssh access. 
                             The firewall will need to have port forwarding rules to allow us remote access.
                        When the system goes into production, the site has the option of having 
                            local IT trained for support or to continue remote support.
                        

Site Visit
    * physical-location
                        The server needs 
                            * unswitched power (always on)
                            * ethernet jack
                            * location with low human traffic to minimize accidental disconnect, damage, or vandilizm.
                            
    * verify the location will have 24/7 power and temperature control
                            
    * Designated-contact
                        person responsible for taking trouble calls to power cycle the server
                        
                        
Configure DNS
    * add new server to DNS
        * if the host name is HI-Studio.eyc-labs.com, add host to Dynu
        * if the host name is id the school's domain, school's IT staff needs to add the host record to DNS
    * N.B. adding the host to the school's domain needs 48 hours for the change to propagage

Build the server image
    * Host name - FQDN
    * Jamulus server name
    * configure Dynu client
    
    Some standard things we need to define
    * SSH support credentials
    * email target for log reports
    * email target for support alarms
