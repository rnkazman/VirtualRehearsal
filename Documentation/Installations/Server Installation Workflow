Planning
    * IP address        Will the server be behind a NAT or a router?
                        If behind a NAT, then this is a small network and the server will be in the DMZ.
                        IF behind a router, then the site needs to assign an IP address.
                        
    * Host name         If host is behind a NAT, then select a host name in the form of <host>.eyc-labs.com
                            where perferably <host> = HI-Studio<num>. We will assign value of <num>.
                        If the host is behind a router, the selewct a host name in the form of <host>.<domain name>.
                            Ex: <domain name> = punahou.edu.
                            where preferably (for the evaluation period) <host> = HI-Studio<num>.
                        Ideally we want the central Jamulus server to show our test servers as HI-Studio<num>.
                        
     * Remote-support-aggrement
                        Confirm agreement for remote-support. 
                        During the evaluation phase, we need remote ssh access. 
                             The firewall will need to have port forwarding rules to allow us remote access.
                        When the system goes into production, the site has the option of having 
                            local IT trained for support or to continue remote support.
                        

Site Visit
    * physical-location
                        The server needs 
                            * unswitched power (always on)
                            * ethernet jack
                            * location with low human traffic to minimize accidental disconnect, damage, or vandilizm.
                            
    * verify the location will have 24/7 power and temperature control
                            
    * Designated-contact
                        person responsible for taking trouble calls to power cycle the server
