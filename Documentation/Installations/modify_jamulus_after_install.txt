1) Notes assume that you have logged in to the studio server with SSH (no GUI) to studioadm
2) Use sudo su - to switch to root
3) The server start command is located in this file on the line that begins with ExecStart:
  3a) /etc/systemd/system/jamulus.service
  3b) edit the file with vi /etc/systemd/system/jamulus.service
4) The start command uses the Jamulus command line interface to configure the server. The various options can be found here:
  4a) https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/wiki/Command-Line-Options
5) By default, I configured the welcome message to point to a file located here:
  5a) /etc/jamulus/jamulus_welcome
  5b) To edit the welcome message, simply edit that file with vi /etc/jamulus/jamulus_welcome
6) After you have completed editing the server, issue the following commands in order to make the changes take effect:
  6a) systemctl daemon-reload
  6b) systemctl stop jamulus
  6c) systemctl start jamulus
